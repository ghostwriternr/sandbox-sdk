# Session Execution Architecture

This document describes the current command execution model in the sandbox
runtime. The model utilizes process handles for execution, and separates shell sessions and terminal/PTY interaction.

## Goals

1. Make top-level execution stateless unless the caller explicitly creates a
   session.
2. Preserve shell state for explicit command sessions (`cd`, `export`, aliases,
   functions, sourced scripts).
3. `exec()` returns a process handle, and `output()` is the buffered convenience.
4. Keep terminal resources separate from command sessions. Terminals expose PTY
   bytes, not structured stdout/stderr.

## Public Execution Surfaces

| API                      | State persists?                    | Backend                                                    | Output model                |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| `sandbox.exec(string)`   | No                                 | Native `ctx.container.exec(['/bin/bash', '-lc', command])` | Workerd-like process handle |
| `sandbox.exec(string[])` | No                                 | Native `ctx.container.exec(argv)`                          | Workerd-like process handle |
| `session.exec(string)`   | Yes                                | Persistent `CommandSession` shell                          | Workerd-like process handle |
| `session.exec(string[])` | Inherits session cwd/env at launch | Session runtime process                                    | Workerd-like process handle |
| `sandbox.terminal()`     | Independent PTY state              | Terminal manager                                           | PTY bytes                   |

`exec()` returns a process handle, and `output()` is the buffered convenience. Let's look at the implementation details.

## Top-Level Stateless Execution

Top-level calls do not create or reuse hidden sessions.

```text
sandbox.exec(command)
  -> ProcessService.executeCommand(..., sessionId omitted)
  -> ExecutionService.executeSessionless(...)
  -> StatelessCommandRunner.exec(...)
```

`StatelessCommandRunner` runs a one-shot shell command. Each call gets only the
explicit `cwd`, `env`, and timeout options supplied for that call. State changes
such as `cd`, `export`, aliases, and shell functions do not persist.

For streaming/lifecycle:

```text
sandbox.startProcess(command)
  -> ProcessService.startProcess(..., sessionId omitted)
  -> ExecutionService.startSessionlessProcessStream(...)
  -> StatelessProcessRunner.start(...)
```

`StatelessProcessRunner` owns stdout/stderr streaming, wait, kill, timeouts, and
process-tree termination for sessionless processes.

## Explicit Command Sessions

Explicit sessions are persistent, structured command sessions. `SessionManager`
owns the per-session queue and lifecycle; the actual shell runtime lives in
`@repo/sandbox-execution`.

```text
session.exec(command)
  -> SessionManager.executeInSession(...)
  -> RuntimeBackedSession.exec(...)
  -> CommandSession.exec(...)
```

`CommandSession.exec()` runs in the persistent bash shell so state changes write
back to the session. It returns a process handle, and calling `output()` on it resolves with:

```ts
{
  exitCode: number;
  stdout: Uint8Array;
  stderr: Uint8Array;
}
```

Because this command runs in the main persistent shell, it is not a process
lifecycle API. It does not expose streaming, `kill()`, or recoverable
cancellation. If callers need lifecycle control, they should use
`session.startProcess()`.

## Session Processes

`session.startProcess()` starts a process from a snapshot of the current session
state.

```text
session.startProcess(command)
  -> SessionManager.startProcessStreamInSession(...)
  -> RuntimeBackedSession.startRuntimeProcessStream(...)
  -> CommandSession.startProcess(...)
```

The process can stream stdout/stderr and can be killed or timed out. Changes made
inside that process do not write back to the parent command session. This keeps
process lifecycle deterministic while preserving the useful behavior that
session-defined cwd/env/aliases/functions are available when the process starts.

### Output Events

Process streaming emits structured events through the container service layer:

- `start` with the process PID.
- `stdout` and `stderr` chunks while the process runs.
- `complete` with exit code and final result, or `error` if startup/lifecycle
  fails.

The container service layer keeps existing `ProcessRecord`, command handle, and
SSE framing semantics. The execution package owns the shell/process mechanics.

## Terminal Resources

Terminals are independent PTY resources, not command-session helpers.

`sandbox.terminal()` returns a terminal resource handle. Terminal IDs are
stable resource names, not durable shell sessions: reconnecting with the same
ID reattaches to the same live PTY while the container runtime is still alive.
If the runtime restarts, connecting with the same ID creates a fresh shell, and
command history and process state from the prior runtime are gone. Terminal PTY
state is separate from command-session state and does not provide structured
stdout/stderr command results.

```text
sandbox.terminal({ id, cwd, shell })
  -> terminals.createTerminal({ id, cwd, shell, cols, rows }) over RPC
  -> /ws/terminal?terminalId=... for byte transport
```

Terminal lifecycle operations such as `destroy()` use semantic RPC methods;
`/ws/terminal` is the byte transport for attaching to an existing terminal.

## Persistent Exec Mechanics

`CommandSession.exec()` runs commands in persistent bash shells:

1. Run the command in the persistent bash shell so state can persist.
2. Redirect stdout and stderr to command-specific temp files.
3. Wait for shell redirections to finish.
4. Publish a bounded completion frame or exit-code marker.
5. Read stdout/stderr files and return final strings.

The important design point is that temp-file redirects are synchronous from the
shell's point of view. Bash waits for the command's redirected output to finish
before the integration reports command completion.

## Completion Signaling

The runtime command session emits framed control messages on stdout and uses
command-specific result files for bounded stdout/stderr reads. Process streaming
uses FIFO readers internally, but that machinery is private to the execution
package and is exposed only through `startProcess()` APIs.

## Error Handling

| Scenario                   | Behavior                                                                          |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Invalid per-command `cwd`  | Command does not run; stderr explains the failed directory change                 |
| `exec()` timeout           | The command session is failed when safe recovery is not guaranteed                |
| Shell exit during `exec()` | The session is marked terminated and later calls recover through `SessionManager` |
| `startProcess()` timeout   | Runtime terminates the process tree and preserves partial output                  |
| `startProcess().kill()`    | Runtime signals the process tree                                                  |
| Terminal destroy           | `TerminalManager` destroys the PTY resource                                       |

## Concurrency

`SessionManager` serializes operations per explicit command session. Completion
commands run one at a time because they mutate shell state. Process streaming
holds the session lock only long enough to start the process and capture its
handle; the process then runs independently so later session commands can run.

Different sessions and stateless top-level processes can run concurrently.
